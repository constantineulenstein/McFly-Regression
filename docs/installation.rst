Installation
============

Prerequisites:

* Python 3.6, 3.7 or 3.8
* pip
* Tensorflow 2.0, if pip errors that it canâ€™t find it for your python/pip version


Installing all dependencies in separate conda environment:

.. code:: sh

   conda env create -f environment.yml

   # activate this new environment
   source activate mcfly

To install the package, run in the project directory:

``pip install .``

Installing on Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When installing on Windows, there are a few things to take into
consideration. The preferred (in other words: easiest) way to install
Keras and mcfly is as follows:

* Use `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download>`__
* Install numpy and scipy through the conda package manager (and not with pip)
* To install mcfly, run ``pip install mcfly`` in the cmd prompt.
* Loading and saving models can give problems on Windows, see https://github.com/NLeSC/mcfly-tutorial/issues/17


Visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We build a tool to visualize the configuration and performance of the
models. The tool can be found on http://nlesc.github.io/mcfly/. To run
the model visualization on your own computer, cd to the ``html``
directory and start up a python web server:

``python -m http.server 8888 &``

Navigate to ``http://localhost:8888/`` in your browser to open the
visualization. For a more elaborate description of the visualization see
`user
manual <https://mcfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_manual.html>`__.
